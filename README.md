# SQL-Sales-Analysis-Project

## Overview
This repository contains a SQL project focused on analyzing sales data from a hypothetical retail business. The project involves writing and executing various SQL queries to answer specific business questions related to sales performance, product popularity, and promotional effectiveness. The data used in this project is from the SH schema, which includes tables like COUNTRIES, CUSTOMERS, SALES, PRODUCTS, TIMES, and CHANNELS.

## Significance for Business
1. Performance Analysis
By identifying the top three countries with the highest total sales, businesses can focus their efforts on regions that yield the highest revenue, optimizing resource allocation, and marketing strategies to maximize profitability.

2. Product Popularity
Analyzing the most sold products in the US over multiple years helps in understanding consumer preferences and trends. This information is crucial for inventory management, product development, and targeted marketing campaigns.

3. Revenue Maximization
Identifying the product with the highest sales revenue and analyzing its sales channels provide insights into the most effective sales channels. This can help businesses optimize their sales strategies and enhance channel performance.

4. Underperforming Markets
Identifying countries with the poorest sales performance enables businesses to investigate underlying issues, develop targeted strategies to improve sales in these regions, and prevent revenue loss.

5. Promotional Analysis
Creating and analyzing a materialized view for promotion-wise sales data helps businesses understand the impact of different promotions on sales. This is essential for planning future promotions, optimizing marketing budgets, and enhancing promotional effectiveness.

6. Aggregated Insights
Using ROLLUP and CUBE functions to provide aggregated sales data allows management to gain a comprehensive view of sales performance across different dimensions. This supports strategic decision-making, helps identify key sales drivers, and ensures data-driven business planning.

7. Strategic Decision-Making
Leveraging existing aggregated tables to derive useful information for management helps in tracking the effectiveness of specific promotions and channels. This information is vital for making informed decisions about product promotions, inventory management, and marketing strategies.
